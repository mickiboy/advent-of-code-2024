# Advent of Code 2024

In this repository, you'll find my solutions to the
[Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) puzzles.

## Day 1

First, I started by writing the unit test. Conveniently, there's an example
list, which I used here, so I can easily test if my function works.

## Day 2

I feel embarrassed it took me this long to see all edge cases. And here I
thought just writing the unit tests first and implement afterwards would be
enough. What a fool I am!
